# The Ultimate Plugin Template for 1.17.1
A Spigot Plugin Template for 1.17.1 plugins!

This is assuming java is installed at "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.2\bin\java.exe"

To Change Build location go to the pom.xml file and the <configuration> tab! 
  Once there customize the <outputFile> location with yours and make sure to include a \PluginName.jar so its a jar file!
 
You can customize your details under the src > main > resources > plugin.yml
To change project version go to the top of pom.xml and change where it says 1.0-SNAPSHOT to your plugin version!
  
Hopefully this can help someone!
